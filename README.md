Hello, I'm Rama, I created this project with the aim of completing a task from [Ambisius Lab](https://www.ambisius.com/) for a job vacancy as a Full-time Software Engineer.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
